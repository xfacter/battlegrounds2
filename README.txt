GAMEPLAY
----------------------------------
The HUD contains three bars: health meter, boost meter, and heat meter, in that
order. The goal of the game is relatively simple. Capture flags and destroy
enemies. You have a few abilities at your disposal to accomplish this goal,
including cannons, lasers, mines, and boost. While in game, you can turn on a
useful option, target lock. With target lock on, you need only be aiming in the
general direction of your enemy. Press and hold the right trigger and you will
lock onto the enemy. Should you choose not to use this feature, you must
manually aim and strafe to destroy your enemies.
